### 👋 Hi, I'm Tony Duco (or nosduco)

🔭 I spend a lot of my time building, learning, and managing software! I’m currently
working in the tech industry as a Staff Engineer with strong technical skills in 
Full-stack Web Development, DevOps, and Infrastructure. Keep a look out on my 
profile for my various personal projects (Vim plugins, Linux utilities, Website, etc)

⚡ My interests and motivations mainly live in linux, open source software, and
high-scaling infrastructure.

🌱 I’m currently learning about scalable system designs, cloud platforms and
frameworks (CloudFlare, Kubernetes, AWS), and constantly learning new programming languages
and frameworks.
